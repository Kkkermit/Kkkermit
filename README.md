## Hi, I'm Kkermit.!

My coding journey began when I was just 16 years old. I got my first PC and enjoyed playing using Discord. When I discovered that custom experiences could be created, I eagerly dove into learning Discord.js. I had been dreaming of learning to code since I was 9, and discovering Discord.js gave me the perfect opportunity to do so.

### Exploring Back-End Development

As I continued to grow and learn, I felt a strong desire to expand my skillset and delve deeper into the various facets of programming. My curiosity led me to explore the world of back-end development, which plays a crucial role in building the backbone of web applications and services. Eager to master this domain, I began learning Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to create scalable server-side applications.

As I progressed in my journey, I realized the importance of understanding not only server-side programming but also the complex interplay between front-end and back-end technologies. This realization drove me to expand my knowledge of databases, API integrations, and other aspects of full-stack development. My continuous learning and passion for back-end development have opened up new horizons for me in the world of software development, allowing me to create more sophisticated and robust applications.

### Diving into Full-Stack and Software Development

My experiences with both front-end and back-end technologies led me to explore full-stack development. With a strong foundation in web and software development, I'm now adept at creating comprehensive, end-to-end solutions for various projects. My passion for coding continues to grow as I constantly learn and innovate in the realm of full-stack and software development. Fast forward a year, and now I'm here on GitHub, sharing everything I learn and create!

### Connect with me

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me on my linked socials. Let's learn and grow together!
